        <p class="description">“Men aren't really complicated, Ana, honey. They
          are very simple, literal creatures. They usually mean what they say. 
          And we spend hours trying to analyze what they've said - when really 
          it's obvious. If I were you, I'd take him literally. That might help.”

          continues his sweet, leisurely torment, backward, forward. “Every time
          you move tomorrow, I want you to be reminded that I’ve been here.
          Only me. You are mine.” ― E.L. James, Fifty Shades of Grey </p>

          Perhaps I've spent too long in the company of my literary romantic heroes, 
          and consequently my ideals and expectations are far too high.”

        <p class="description">“His head turns fractionally toward me, his eyes 
          darkest slate. I bite my lip.
          “Oh, f*ck the paperwork,” he growls. He lunges at me, pushing me 
          against the wall of the elevator. Before I know it, he’s got both of 
          my hands in one of his in a vice-like grip above my head, and he’s 
          pinning me to the wall using his hips. Holy sh*t. His other hand grabs
          my ponytail and yanks down, bringing my face up, and his lips are on 
          mine. It’s only just not painful. I moan into his mouth, giving his 
          tongue an opening. He takes full advantage, his tongue expertly 
          exploring my mouth. I have never been kissed like this.”

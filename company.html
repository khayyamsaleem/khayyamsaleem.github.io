      <p>Welcome to Better Living Industries, where dreams can be fulfilled, 
        if your monetary ranking is deemed acceptable. We at Better Living 
        Industries have been dedicated to a clean and structured lifestyle 
        since the great fires of 2012. Bleaching the Zones and the quantitative 
        analysis of the population have been effective means of ridding you, 
        the consumer, of the unwanted waste. We, the organization, firmly 
        believe in the sanctity of monochromaticism. By organizing the 
        organisms we have revealed life's true hidden values and discovered 
        ways to attain and monetize that value. So ask yourself this, 
        "Why Try?" Simply kick back and let us wash the grime out of your world.
        You have the means, you live to buy, why not buy to live a color-free 
        existence. 
      </p>
      <p>Through commerce and the correct combination of medication BLI has to 
        offer, you too can be a happy well adjusted part of the populous. Long 
        gone are the inefficient days when the consumer needed love, sex, 
        makeup, or reassurance... these lustful idiosyncrasies left you feeling
        empty, tired, and weak. But now, you too can be fulfilled! Fill your
        heart with synthetic happiness, erase pain with ease, digitize your
        memories, and protect your interests with customizable blasters all at
        our one stop shop. Don't let the world get you down. Instead, bring the
        world down to your level!
      </p>
      <p>Tired from a long day out on the Zones? Need a few laughs? Dinner 
        and a beer with an old friend? Don't be silly. These antique emotions 
        are worthless and in the long run will never fully complete you! Human
        contact is pointless and holds no equity. Can you resell a friendship?
        Can you trade in your mothers love for a transportation upgrade? No,
        you can not. When the people we claim to love fade, their price point
        becomes null and void. Never again waste precious time building false
        cathedrals. 9 out of 10 relationships conclude leaving little to no
        resale value and end up weighing the consumer down.
